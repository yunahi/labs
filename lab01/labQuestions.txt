**What is OpenGL? Why is it sometimes referred to as a state machine?

Open Graphics Library, is a cross-platform API that can let you create
2D and 3D graphics using the GPU. OpenGL has a global state that can be
changed in lots of different ways. For example, certain settings
(e.g. GL_DEPTH_TEST, GL_BLEND) can be enabled or disabled. Depending on OpenGL’s
 state, certain operations might behave very differently.

cross-platform API that creates 2D and 3D graphics using the GPU. It is referred
to as a state machine because its state can change.

**What is a VBO and why is it important?

OpenGL is able to store arrays of data on the GPU in something called a buffer
object. When a buffer object contains vertex data (such as vertex positions),
it’s called a vertex buffer object, or VBO.

Where open gl stores data such as vertex position

**What is a VAO and why is it important?

In order to associate attributes with the data in the VBO, we need something
called a vertex array object, or VAO. This is a pretty confusing name, as it’s
not actually an array of vertex data. (That’s the VBO!) The VAO is an object
that knows how to draw the data in a VBO because it knows what attributes are
stored in it.

VAO associates attribute with the data in the VBO. VAO is important becuase
without it OpenGl will not know how to treat the data in VBO

**What were the drawing modes covered in this lab and how do they differ?

Triangle, strip and fan. Triangle is just a triangle but with strip and fan,
we can avoid repeating vertices because OpenGl knows how to assemble them
