Be prepared to answer one or more of the following questions from the TA:
* Describe the three transformation matrices in this lab.
    * translation, rotation, scale
* In code, what order would you write the multiplication for a vec3 and the perspective(projection), view, and model matrices?
    * perspective, view, model
* What is the difference between vertex shaders and fragment shaders?
    * vertex shaders process each vertex individually before rendering.  Fragment shaders, on the other hand output a color for every pixel, aka “fragment.”  
* What is a uniform variable?
    * applies to all vertex
* Please describe the format of the UV coordinates using the four corners of your monitor.
    * (0,0)(0,1)(1,0)(1,1)
