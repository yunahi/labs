What do the pixel values in a grayscale image represent? 
 the pixels only carry intensity information

Describe the process of convolving an image with a kernel.
Kernels kind of defines the weight of the neighbouring pixels

What happens when the kernel exceeds the boundary of an image?
In this lab, we ignored it. meaning the rgb values were left at 0.

Provide a kernel to shift an image three pixels downwards.
